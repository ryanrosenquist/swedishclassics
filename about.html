    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>
      This site was created by Ryan Rosenquist, with a deep love of Swedish home cooking and a 
      passion for food that has grown throughout his life. 
      Ryan was born and raised in the USA, but from the start had a strong connection to 
      Sweden through his Swedish father. Growing up in the 1990s, food became a way to keep 
      Swedish culture alive at home – meatballs, pancakes, pea soup and other classics were often 
      made in the kitchen and became a natural part of everyday life.<br><br>

      When Ryan later moved to Sweden his interest deepened further. 
      What began as childhood memories developed into many years of experience cooking Swedish 
      home-style dishes at home, focusing on tradition, simple ingredients and genuine joy in food. 
      This site is a way to share that passion – to inspire, preserve classic flavors and show that Swedish 
      food is both simple, comforting and full of heart.</center>
